# Poltype Installation Guide

**To get started you will need to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#) (Linux Distribution) to your home directory on ARC**

- To dowload it to your working directory use `wget "link"` using the link to the anaconda install 

- Use `chmod +x` to make the install script executable, run the install script

- Towards the end of the install it may prompt you to initialize anaconda for your bash shell: `conda init bash`
  This will modify your bashrc script to allow ARC to activate your base conda environment on start up of a new terminal. If you opt out of this step you will need to specify the absolute path to anaconda in the future

- For now activate your conda environment with `source activate` (or if that does not work `conda activate`) and you should see your base environment is activated
