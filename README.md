# Welborn Lab Documentation

This is where we keep general documentation for the tasks and software used in the group! Note that not all documentation is linked through the workflows below.


Below you will find a general tutorial and walkthrough on preparing a protein system for Tinker MD simulations.

An older workflow for simulating proteins is here (link workflow) and simple carbohydrates here (link workflow)



## Introduction
This tutorial will go through the process of preparing a protein for a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the Tinker MD engine. This is a general overview and can be adapted to fit your needs and specific systems. The galectin-3 protein will be used as an example throughout this tutorial. There will always be multiple ways to accomplish some steps and these will be mentioned when possible!
