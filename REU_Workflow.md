# Workflow for REU students - Summer 2024

## Create Carbohydrate Structures

Divide up the monosaccharides between each other, just make sure you are not both doing the same structures twice!

Use the glycam carbohydrate builder to generate the initial carbohydrate structure. Make sure that the stereochemistry and substituent groups are correct for each structure. (double check please) Then save the minimized PDB file. 

Open the .pdb file in Avogadro, and save the molecule again as a .mol file

## Poltype

Poltype2 is the program we will use to generate the parameters for these carbohydrate molecules

This is the first major step in your project this summer, we will work on getting most of the carbohydrates parameterized first before working on the next steps.

First you will need to install Poltype2 on ARC, see `[Poltype_Install.md](https://github.com/WelbornGroup/Documentation/blob/REU_update/Poltype_Install.md)

The output of the parameterization will include a
