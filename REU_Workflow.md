# Workflow for REU students - Summer 2024

## Create Carbohydrate Structures

Divide up the monosaccharides between each other, just make sure you are not both doing the same structures!

Use the glycam carbohydrate builder to generate the initial carbohydrate structure. Make sure (double check please) that the stereochemistry and substituent groups are correct for each structure. Then save the minimized PDB file. 

Open the .pdb file in Avogadro, and then save the molecule again as a .mol file

## Poltype

Poltype2 is the program we will use to generate the parameters for these carbohydrate molecules




## Solvation 

The output of the parameterization will include a 

## Molecular Dynamics

## Analysis with VMD
