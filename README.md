# Welborn Lab Documentation

This is where we keep documentation for the tasks and software used in the group!


Below you will find a general tutorial and walkthrough on preparing a protein system for Tinker MD simulations.

An older workflow for simulating proteins is [here](previous_workflow.md) and simple carbohydrates [here](REU_Workflow.md)
Note that not all documentation is linked through the workflows.



## Introduction
This tutorial will go through the process of preparing a protein for a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the Tinker MD engine. This is a general overview and can be adapted to fit your needs and specific systems. The galectin-3 protein will be used as an example throughout this tutorial. There will always be multiple ways to accomplish some steps and these will be mentioned when possible! 

 ## Protein File
To start, head over the [RSCB Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org) to find the protein of interest. Search for the protein by name (galectin-3) or by its unique PDB ID (1KJL)
