# Workflow for REU students - Summer 2024

## Create Carbohydrate Structures

Divide up the monosaccharides between each other, just make sure you both are not doing the same structures twice!

Use the glycam carbohydrate builder to generate the initial carbohydrate structure. Make sure that the stereochemistry and substituent groups are correct for each structure. (double check please) Then save the minimized PDB file. 

Open the `.pdb` file in Avogadro, and save the molecule again as a `.mol` file

## Poltype

Poltype2 is the program we will use to generate the parameters for these carbohydrate molecules

This is the first major step in your project this summer, we will work on getting most of the carbohydrates parameterized first before working on the following steps.

First you will need to install Poltype2 on ARC, see [Poltype_Install.md](https://github.com/WelbornGroup/Documentation/blob/REU_update/Poltype_Install.md) for directions.

Once installed, see the [Poltype_Usage](https://github.com/WelbornGroup/Documentation/blob/REU_update/Poltype_Usage.md) for instructions on running Poltype2 for a molecule on ARC 

## Solvation 

These are the next steps we will take after paramterization of the carbohydrate molecules is complete

## Molecular Dynamics

## Analysis with VMD
